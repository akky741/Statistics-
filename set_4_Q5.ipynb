    "An educational startup that helps MBA aspirants write their essays is targeting individuals who have taken GMAT in 2012 and have expressed interest in applying to FT top 20 b-schools. There are 40000 such individuals with an average GMAT score of 720 and a standard deviation of 120. The scores are distributed between 650 and 790 with a very long and thin tail towards the higher end resulting in substantial skewness. Which of the following is likely to be true for randomly chosen samples of aspirants?\n",
